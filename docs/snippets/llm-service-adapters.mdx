Service Adapters are responsible for executing the request with the LLM and standardizing the request/response format in a way that the Copilot Runtime can understand.

Currently, we support the following service providers/adapters:

- [OpenAIAdapter](/reference/classes/CopilotRuntime/service-adapters/OpenAIAdapter)
- [OpenAIAssistantAdapter](/reference/classes/CopilotRuntime/service-adapters/OpenAIAssistantAdapter)
- [LangChainAdapter](/reference/classes/CopilotRuntime/service-adapters/LangChainAdapter)
- [GroqAdapter](/reference/classes/CopilotRuntime/service-adapters/GroqAdapter)
- [GoogleGenerativeAIAdapter](/reference/classes/CopilotRuntime/service-adapters/GoogleGenerativeAIAdapter)
- [AnthropicAdapter](/reference/classes/CopilotRuntime/service-adapters/AnthropicAdapter)

The above are the built in native LLM service adapters, but you can also use the **`LangChainAdapter`** to use any LLM provider we don't yet natively support.
